Database Server
=================

## Description
Database Server Tech Test

## User Stories
```
As an employer
So that I can consider your application for a role in the company
I would like to assess your understanding of web technologies
```

## Instructions
"Before your interview, write a program that runs a server that is accessible on ```http://localhost:4000/```. When your server receives a request on ```http://localhost:4000/set?somekey=somevalue``` it should store the passed key and value in memory. When it receives a request on```http://localhost:4000/get?key=somekey``` it should return the value stored at **somekey**. Store the data in memory, not in a database, but bear in mind that you will later need to add a database to this code."

#### Bonus
"If you still have time at the end of the day, you can extend the code by adding a data store of your choice."
